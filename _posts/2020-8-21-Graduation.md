title: Confessions of a Recent PhD Graduate
---

Hello World

My name is Dr. James McFarlane and I was a PhD candidate/student from 2014 to 2020. Six long years of courses, teaching, starting projects, finishing projects, and looking back at unfinished projects has left me wondering about the skills that I've actually acquired over this time. Moreover, if I was to go back and do it again, how would I do things differently? This blog will be the first of many to try to relearn key skills and concepts in the field of computer-assisted drug design and biomolecular simulations. In addition to these things, I hope to touch on topics such as best practices, mentorship, and other facets of being a graduate student that should be addressed at the start of a graduate science degree.

It feels as if I know less now than when I started, but I know this cannot possibly be true — sentiments associated with the rampantly prevalent condition in academia known as [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and spurred on by the nature of the academic environment. After successfully defending my PhD, I've now had to come to terms with the most difficult realization of my entire graduate degree: I actually know some stuff (and pretty gosh darned well). On top of this, I'm also coming to terms with an identity as a scientist, not "just" a computational chemist or whatever label someone from a different discipline is comfortable with slapping on me. Throughout my studies, I've leaned into biology, chemistry, computer science, and numerous respective sub-disciplines. Also, being an outgoing scientist who loves to discuss research and get excited about it, this does not make me a "cocktail scientist" as one person once labelled me, alluding to some notion that I belonged to a class of scientists that were inferior. The thing about labels in science is they are often self-prescribed and used as a shield or a sword for egos. I've also seen labels used by graduate students, full professsors, and even departmental chairs. "What does a _______ know about ________ ?" or "I see equations and I just give up. I'm a ______ scientist, I don't need to know this stuff." Think about the opportunities lost and the damage done – the lost collaborations and learning opportunities – missing out on the beauty of understanding. 

There is great beauty in crossing the line into ["understanding" from "knowing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-zWTU7X-k). The late Richard Feynmann [tells stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_7j72CVlc) of how his father takes him for walks in the woods and points to a bird. "What is the name of this bird?", he would say. He would then list several names of the bird in various languages and remark that knowing all the names in the world for that bird would tell you nothing about the bird itself. In my PhD, the discovery of new concepts were always best enjoyed through application and an understanding of the scope and imagining how they could be applied to something else. Feymann's birds are also a great reminder to help oneself make the distinction of knowing and understanding which can lead to understanding. This blog is my attempt to put beaks and feathers on a number of ideas and methods that I am familiar with (such as machine learning and molecular simulation techniques) and hope to understand in the near future and take you as a reader through that journey. 

Had enough of this esoteric bologna? Me too. 

If you are reading this as a graduate student, this blog will also contain some concrete lessons about science and grad school in general. Throughout your degree, you will hopefully come across several mentors that will make a profound impact on your life as well as how you conduct yourself as a teacher and a scientist. I am incredible grateful to have had a wonderful supervisor and have brushed shoulders with some of the most insightful people of my field who were also willing to share their experiences. I've learned kindess, compassion, professional discourse, and the ability to navigate the academic world as a scientist. Equally important, and through the strugggle of first hand experience, I have learned many pitfalls that can risk the value of your work. Not to say the work I have produced has no value; there were just many opportunities to elevate it to the next level. I'd like to share with you a short list (Thank you, Martin) that was presented to a group of postdocs and grad students during a Gordon Research Conference in 2015:

Seven Rules for Achieving No Impact (and how I've been guilty of doing every one of these at least once):

1. Focus on concepts you understand
2. Use computational tools uncritically
3. Don't distinguish between fact and hypothesis
4. Reinvent the wheel
5. Avoid comparison to experimental data
6. Disregard detail
7. Be a hindsight expert

The next blog will address this list and the lessons learned behind making each of these mistakes. I wil also be diving into how I've rectified them or plan to do so in the future. I look forward to documenting my next journey as a postdoc with you all and sharing the lessons learned on the way.
