title: Confessions of a Recent PhD Graduate
---

Hello World

My name is James McFarlane and I've been a PhD candidate/student since 2014. Six long years of courses, teaching, starting projects, finishing projects, and looking back at unfinished projects has left me wondering about the skills that I've actually acquired over this time. Moreover, if I was to go back and do it again, how would I do things differently? This blog will be the first of many to try to relearn key skills and concepts in the field of computer-assisted drug design and biomolecular simulations. In addition to these things, I hope to touch on topics such as best practices, mentorship, and other facets of being a graduate student that should be addressed at the start of a graduate science degree.

It feels as if I know less now than when I started, but I know this cannot possibly be true — sentiments associated with the rampantly prevalent condition in academia known as [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and spurred on by the sometimes toxic nature of the academic environment. After successfully defending my PhD, I've now had to come to terms with the most difficult realization of my entire graduate degree: I actually know some stuff (and pretty gosh darned well). On top of this, I'm also coming to terms with an identity as a scientist, not "just" a computational chemist or whatever label someone from a different discipline is comfortable with slapping on me. Through my studies, I've leaned into biology, chemistry, computer science, and numerous respective sub-disciplines. Also, as an outgoing scientist who loves to discuss research and get excited about it, this does not make me a "cocktail scientist" as one person once described me, alluding to some notion that I belonged to a class of scientists that were inferior. One thing I've noticed about labels in science is they are often self-prescribed and used a shield or a sword for egos. "What does a _______ know about ________ ?" or "I see equations and I just give up. I'm a ______ scientist, I don't need to know this stuff." Think about the opportunities lost and the damage done – The lost collaborations and learning opportunities. Missing out on the beauty of knowing. 

There is great beauty in crossing the line into "knowing" from "knowing of". The late Richard Feynmann tells stories of how his father takes him for walks in the woods and points to a bird. "What is the name of this bird?", he would say. He would then list several names of the bird in various languages and remark that knowing all the names in the world for that bird would tell you nothing about the bird. In my PhD, the discovery of new concepts were always best enjoyed through application and an understanding of the scope and imagining how they could be applied to something else. Take for example a molecular simulation technique applied to a very specific problem: Understanding the mechanisms underlying the method and how it can be applied to a different system to glean information previously inaccessible. Over the past several years, Feymann's birds has been a motivator in looking beyond the facade of a body of knowledge and to at least let me acknowledge when I don't know something, but make that space for when I am ready to fully dive in. 



Seven Rules for Achieving No Impact (and how I've been guilty of doing every one of these at least once):

1. Focus on concepts you understand
2. Use computational tools uncritically
3. Don't distinguish between fact and hypothesis
4. Reinvent the wheel
5. Avoid comparison to experimental data
6. Disregard detail
7. Be a hindsight expert
