title: Lessons Learned and Unlearned: Confessions of an Incipient PhD Graduate
---

Hello World,

My name is James McFarlane and I've been a PhD candidate/student since 2014 with an upcoming defence at the end of July of 2020. Six long years of courses, teaching, starting projects, finishing projects, and looking back at unfinished projects has left me feeling uncertain about the skills that I've actually acquired over this time. It feels as if I know less now than when I started, but I know this cannot possibly be true â€” sentiments shared with many others with a condition rampantly prevalent in academia known as [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
