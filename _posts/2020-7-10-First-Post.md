title: Confessions of an Incipient PhD Graduate
---

Hello World

My name is James McFarlane and I've been a PhD candidate/student since 2014 with an upcoming defence at the end of July of 2020. Six long years of courses, teaching, starting projects, finishing projects, and looking back at unfinished projects has left me feeling uncertain about the skills that I've actually acquired over this time. Moreover, did I do it right? Was there a better way to do it? 

This blog will be the first of many to try to relearn key skills and concepts in the field of computer-assisted drug design and biomolecular simulations. In addition to these things, I hope to touch on topics such as best practices, mentorship, and other facets of being a graduate student that should be addressed at the start of a graduate science degree.

It feels as if I know less now than when I started, but I know this cannot possibly be true â€” sentiments associated with the rampantly prevalent condition in academia known as [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). Although this might just be a product of knowing now how little I actually know.

Seven Rules for Achieving No Impact (and how I basically did exactly this):

1. Focus on concepts you understand
2. Use computational tools uncritically
3. Don't distinguish between fact and hypothesis
4. Reinvent the wheel
5. Avoid comparison to experimental data
6. Disregard detail
7. Be a hindsight expert
